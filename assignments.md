# Assignments

There will be five forms of assessment over the quarter: in-person discussion/participation, writing assignments, presenting & leading a discussion, a group project, and a final exam. All deadlines are given in PT.

<!--
## Writing Assignments

You will need to submit critiques each week of the quarter, until you receive at least three "A" grades on your critiques. Once you have submitted three "A" quality critiques, you have indicated your mastery and may stop submitting them.   

Detailed [instructions for critiques here](https://kristenvaccaro.github.io/antisocial-computing/critiques.html).  

Writing assignments will be due at 5PM Friday, every week.

## Scribing

You will need to provide scribe notes for one class session once during the quarter (either a Wednesday or Friday class).    

Scribe notes should convey the key concepts, definitions, and discussions covered in class. You should highlight the most interesting or compelling content (in your opinion), and should provide detail about relevant arguments, connections, etc. where needed. 

Notes should be well-organized, using logical sectional divisions as appropriate. Write in complete sentences. Make sure other students can understand what you've written.

Do not transcribe the full text of all comments made. Do not typeset the contents of the slides and/or blackboard. Do not copy or simply paragraphase material from the readings. Instead, you should perform some synthesis and analysis of what is most important and how it is connected.

Scribe notes will be due three days after your assigned date (excluding weekends).  

## Presenting & Leading Discussion

You will need to present on & lead a discussion about a paper once during the quarter.

## Final Project

Final projects can be done as a small group (max size: 4) or individually. You can choose to create a new platform/interaction, design an experience around an existing system, or conduct an analysis. Half of each Monday class session will be a design studio where you work with your group on this project and get feedback from your peers. 

A brief proposal will be due at the end of week 5.  


## Final Exam

A final exam will evaluate your understanding of the material for the entire quarter. It will consist of open-ended responses, similar to the in-person discussions as well as your writing assignments. The final exam time is set by the university, and can be found on Blink. I am happy to offer a conflict exam. If everyone who is interested can attend the conflict exam time, no reason/excuse is needed. Otherwise, students with more serious conflicts will be prioritized. Look out for a survey near the end of the quarter.
