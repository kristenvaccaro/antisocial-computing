# Assignments

There will be five forms of assessment over the quarter: in-person discussion/participation, writing assignments, presenting & leading a discussion, a group project. All deadlines are given in PT.

<!--
## Writing Assignments

You will need to submit critiques each week of the quarter, until you receive at least three "A" grades on your critiques. Once you have submitted three "A" quality critiques, you have indicated your mastery and may stop submitting them.   

Detailed [instructions for critiques here](https://kristenvaccaro.github.io/antisocial-computing/critiques.html).  

Writing assignments will be due at 5PM Friday, every week.

## Week 1 Assignments (Final Project Teams, Signups for Presenting, Leading Discussion, Scribing)  

Sign up to present and lead discussion **twice** (2x present, 2x lead discussion): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tq-4L7oTREPUxCSXzlxk0xo7Tvv2iIJ2vxuR6rIVayQ/edit?usp=sharing      

## Critique 

You will need to write one [critique](https://kristenvaccaro.github.io/antisocial-computing/critiques.html) on one of the readings for this class. A critique is also due one week after the reading is discussed in class. You do not need to inform us which reading you plan to write the critique for.   

If you do not receive an A, you may resubmit up to two times. Note this is only available if you pick an early week (i.e., feedback can take up to one week, so after week 5 you are not guaranteed to be able to use both submissions).  

## Presenting & Leading Discussion

You will need to present on & lead a discussion about a paper twice (each) during the quarter.  

Detailed [instructions for presentations here](https://kristenvaccaro.github.io/antisocial-computing/discussions.html).  


## Final Project

Final projects can be done as a small group (max size: 4) or individually. You can choose to create a new platform/interaction, design an experience around an existing system, or conduct an analysis.

## Final Exam - OPTIONAL

An optional final exam will be offered for extra credit. The final exam will evaluate your understanding of the material for the entire quarter. It will consist of open-ended questions, similar to the in-person discussions. The final exam time is set by the university, and can be found on Blink.
