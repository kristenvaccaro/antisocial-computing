# Assignments

There will be five forms of assessment over the quarter: online discussion, in-person discussion/participation, programming&design assignments, a group project, and a final exam. All are weighted equally (20% each). All deadlines are given in PT.

## Online Discussion

You will participate in the online discussion before each Monday and Wednesday class. These discussion questions will evaluate your understanding of -- and ability to apply the concepts from -- the reading assigned for that week's class.  

Write your initial response to the questions/prompts by 1PM Monday, before the start of class.   
Write your response to at least 3 of your peers by 1PM Wednesday, before the start of class.  
Online discussions will be assigned on Canvas.  
Your lowest online discussion response score will be dropped automatically.  

## Programming & Design Assignments

You will complete eight weekly programming and design assignments over the course of the quarter. These programming and design assignments will help you understand and apply the concepts we talk about in class.  

Programming assignments will be due at 5PM Friday, every week. No programming/design assignments for the last two weeks of the course.

## Final Project

The default option for the final project is a group project where you will create something cool! Friday class sessions will be design studios where you work with your group on this project and get feedback from your peers. 

If for logisitical or other reasons you don't wish to participate in a group, you may write an artile aimed at online readers. Details are provided [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z_7OENTdXAKFbXCGRtpud51afzR7ye1q7WLU61AUVsY/edit?usp=sharing)


## Final Exam

A final exam will evaluate your understanding of the material for the entire quarter. It will consist of open-ended responses, similar to the online and in-person discussions as well as your homework assignments. The final exam time is set by the university, and can be found on Blink. I am happy to offer a conflict exam. If everyone who is interested can attend the conflict exam time, no reason/excuse is needed. Otherwise, students with more serious conflicts will be prioritized. Look out for a survey near the end of the quarter.
