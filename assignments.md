# Assignments

There will be five forms of assessment over the quarter: in-person discussion/participation, writing assignments, presenting & leading a discussion, a group project, and a final exam. All deadlines are given in PT.

## Writing Assignments

You will need to submit critiques each week of the quarter, until you receive at least three "A" grades on your critiques. Once you have submitted three "A" quality critiques, you have indicated your mastery and may stop submitting them.   

Detailed [instructions for critiques here](https://kristenvaccaro.github.io/antisocial-computing/critiques.html).  

Writing assignments will be due at 5PM Friday, every week.  

## Final Project

The default option for the final project is a group project where you will create something cool! Half of each Friday class session will be a design studio where you work with your group on this project and get feedback from your peers. 

If for logisitical or other reasons you don't wish to participate in a group, you may write a research proposal.  


## Final Exam

A final exam will evaluate your understanding of the material for the entire quarter. It will consist of open-ended responses, similar to the in-person discussions as well as your writing assignments. The final exam time is set by the university, and can be found on Blink. I am happy to offer a conflict exam. If everyone who is interested can attend the conflict exam time, no reason/excuse is needed. Otherwise, students with more serious conflicts will be prioritized. Look out for a survey near the end of the quarter.
