# How to write a critique

The goal of writing critiques is two-fold: you will understand the reading better and you will prepare yourself to write reviews, which is a critical skill for academics. 

### Guidelines

#### Content

A critique should identify the (intended and/or actual) contribution, the strengths and the weaknesses of the paper.   

Your critique should address all or at least most of the questions below (taken from the ACM CSCW 2020 reviewing guidelines):
- What is the intended contribution of the paper?
- How important / novel is the intended contribution of the paper?
- How well does the paper execute this contribution?
- Are there specific weaknesses that would undermine confidence in the paper’s claims or results? 
- How well does the paper communicate the work and contribution to its audience (including situating the work in the context of the research literature)?
- Are there other strengths of the paper (apart from the identified contribution) that should be considered in evaluating it?

#### Evaluating Methods

If you haven’t taken research methods courses in the past, I recommend the following references:

For qualitative methods: "Qualitative Research Practice: A Guide for Social Science Students and Researchers" by Ritchie and Lewis  
For quantitative methods: "Social Science Research: Principles, Methods, and Practices" by Bhattacherjee covers most of the material and is [available for free online](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/79)   
For data mining methods: "Data Mining Concepts and Techniques" by Han, Kamber and Pei  

#### Indications of Quality Work
Critiques should be roughly 1-2 pages. Less than half a page indicates a lack of effort and/or engagement with the article.   
Written clearly in complete sentences.  
Well organized; includes a strong introduction and coherent progression.  
Tone is fair and avoids being unnecessarily harsh.  
Is constructive. Some examples: 
- If the paper is not novel, identifies where prior work has already made this contribution.  
- If the paper fails to achieve its intended contribution, identifies other potential contributions of the paper.   
- Identifies other methods that could be used in conjunction or replacement with the methods to address any shortcomings.   

#### Thoughts/suggestions from other reviewers
