# Presentations & leading discussions

We will use a small-to-large group discussion pattern each week to review and discuss the assigned materials. 

### Guidelines

#### Small Group Discussions

Mondays (or Wednesdays, on weeks with a Monday holiday) will be small group discussions. 

Each week one student will lead their group*. *Students may need to lead groups in pairs, if course enrollment is too high*



#### Evaluating Methods

If you havenâ€™t taken research methods courses in the past, I recommend the following references:

For qualitative methods: "Qualitative Research Practice: A Guide for Social Science Students and Researchers" by Ritchie and Lewis  
For quantitative methods: "Social Science Research: Principles, Methods, and Practices" by Bhattacherjee covers most of the material and is [available for free online](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/79)   
For data mining methods: "Data Mining Concepts and Techniques" by Han, Kamber and Pei  

#### Indications of Quality Work
Critiques should be roughly 1-2 pages. Less than half a page indicates a lack of effort and/or engagement with the article.   
Written clearly in complete sentences.  
Well organized; includes a strong introduction and coherent progression.  
Tone is fair and avoids being unnecessarily harsh.  
Is constructive. Some examples: 
- If the paper is not novel, identifies where prior work has already made this contribution.  
- If the paper fails to achieve its intended contribution, identifies other potential contributions of the paper.   
- Identifies other methods that could be used in conjunction or replacement with the methods to address any shortcomings.
