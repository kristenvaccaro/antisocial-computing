# Presentations & leading discussions

We will begin class with a short review of the papers (5-10 minutes). Then the discussion leaders will introduce their questions and lead the discussion for the remaining time (40-45 min). 

#### Presentations

When you are presenting, you should prepare a _very brief_ presentation to review the key concepts from the paper. The presentation should provide:  
- a summary of the objectives of the paper
- definitions or explanations of key concepts
- identify relationships/connections to concepts previously covered
- examples of an application of the key concepts

Presentations might also include:
- identification of methods, limitations, directions for future work
- description of figures/graphs

Aim for 3-5 min. Presentations that go over 5 min will be cut off.  

Presentations and/or notes (if you choose not to use slides) must be submitted in PDF form on Canvas before the start of class.  

#### Leading Discussion

When you are leading discussion, you should prepare a set of 3-5 questions to prompt class discussion. The goal of the questions is to prompt an engaging discussion of the material with your classmates! Try to choose things that you think will be interesting to talk about. 

Some suggestions:
- Questions you have (i.e., things you thought were difficult to understand)
- Questions about methods (i.e., strengths/weaknesses, alternative approaches)
- Questions about other examples (i.e., Where else do similar issues arise? When have you experienced this in your life?)
- Comparisons (i.e., How is X related to Y? Compare and contrast X with Y? How is this similar/different from X we talked about earlier in the course?)
- Synthesis (i.e., How would you suggest ...? What might happen if you combine X with Y? What would you do to deal with ?) 
- Evaluation (i.e.,  What criteria would you use to assess ...? What is the most important â€¦? What do you think about ...?)

Avoid yes/no questions. What/Why/How are likely to be more engaging.
Do not answer your own questions. As much as possible, avoid sharing your own opinions before the discussion gets rolling.  

Please work with any other discussion leaders that day to create a single set of questions.

Submit your initial list of questions (before combining with any other discussion leaders) to the Canvas assignment before the start of class.
