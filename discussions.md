# Presentations & leading discussions

We will use a small-to-large group discussion pattern each week to review and discuss the assigned materials. 

### Small Group Discussions

Wednesdays will have small group discussions at the end of class.

Each week one student will lead their group*. *Students may need to lead groups in pairs or trios, given the high course enrollment*

#### Presentations

On weeks when your group is presenting, the facilitator should prepare a _very brief_ presentation to review the key concepts from the paper. The presentation should provide:  
- a summary of the objectives of the paper
- definitions or explanations of key concepts
- identify relationships/connections to concepts previously covered
- examples of an application of the key concepts

Presentations might also include:
- identification of methods, limitations, directions for future work
- description of figures/graphs

During the small group session, your group should offer constructive feedback on your presentation.  

The first half of assigned readings will present on Monday. The second half of assigned readings will present on Wednesday. On weeks with an odd number of readings, the larger number will present on Monday (e.g., if there are 5 assigned materials, 1-3 will be presented Mon and 4-5 presented Wed).

Aim for 3-5 min. Presentations that go over 5 min will be cut off.  

Presentations must be submitted in PDF form on Canvas at least one hour prior to class.  

#### Leading Discussion

On weeks when your group is leading discussion, the facilitator should prepare a set of 3-5 questions to prompt class discussion. The goal of the questions is to prompt an engaging discussion of the material with your classmates! Try to choose things that you think will be interesting to talk about. 

Some suggestions:
- Questions you have (i.e., things you thought were difficult to understand)
- Questions about methods (i.e., strengths/weaknesses, alternative approaches)
- Questions about other examples (i.e., Where else do similar issues arise? When have you experienced this in your life?)
- Comparisons (i.e., How is X related to Y? Compare and contrast X with Y? How is this similar/different from X we talked about earlier in the course?)
- Synthesis (i.e., How would you suggest ...? What might happen if you combine X with Y? What would you do to deal with ?) 
- Evaluation (i.e.,  What criteria would you use to assess ...? What is the most important â€¦? What do you think about ...?)

Avoid yes/no questions. What/Why/How are likely to be more engaging.
Do not answer your own questions. As much as possible, avoid sharing your own opinions before the discussion gets rolling.  

During the small group session, your group should offer constructive feedback on your questions.  

After the small group session, converse with the facilitator from any other groups responsible for leading discussion on that day to create a shortlist of questions, 3-5 total across both groups.  

Submit your full list of questions to the Canvas assignment at least one hour prior to class.  

### Large Group Discussions

Wednesdays and Fridays will be large group discussions. 

We will begin with presentations (10-15 minutes). Then the discussion leaders will introduce their questions and lead the discussion for the remaining time (35-40 min).
