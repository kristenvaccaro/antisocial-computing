# Presentations & leading discussions

We will use a small-to-large group discussion pattern each week to review and discuss the assigned materials. 

### Small Group Discussions

Mondays* will be small group discussions. *Or Wednesdays, on weeks with a Monday holiday*

Each week one student will lead their group*. *Students may need to lead groups in pairs, if course enrollment is too high*

- examples of an application of the key concepts

Presentations might also include:
- identification of methods, limitations, directions for future work
- description of figures/graphs

During the small group session, your group should offer constructive feedback on your presentation.  

The first half of assigned readings will present on Wednesday. The second half of assigned readings will present on Friday. On weeks with an odd number of readings, the larger number will present on Wednesday (e.g., Week 4 has 5 assigned materials, so 1-3 will be presented Wed and 4-5 presented Fri).

Presentations must be submitted in PDF form on Canvas at least one hour prior to class.
