# Final Projects

### Week 4: Proposal

Your team's proposal should be 250-500 words (1 page maximum) and should be submitted by the end of Week 4 (Sun 2/5 11:59pm).

Here is a set of example proposals so you can get a sense of the variety of things folks have worked on in the past in this class! Quick shoutout: one of these proposals turned into a paper that we submitted earlier this month and two others are ongoing & likely to be submitted this spring! So if you're interested in research, these projects can be a great place to start!

### Week 8: Pitch Video

Please create a _very brief_ pitch video to interest other students in your project. Your video should be 30-60 seconds. Your goal is to convey why your project is interesting and students might be interested in your topic. 

Submit the video as an unlisted video on Youtube. We will create a playlist from all these videos to share with the class!

### Selected Presentations

A subset of projects (approximately 10-15) will present during class in Week 10. There will be two prizes awarded for top projects that present in Week 10, one student-choice award and one decided by the instructors. Prizes are to be determined, but feel free to weigh in on the Discord. 

### Finals Week Submissions

Your final submission should have the following:

1. A recording of a 5 minute summary of your project. These will be very similar to the in-class presentations (focus on overall motivation, quick overview of methods and results, and connections to course themes). 
2. A one page maximum summary. These will be very similar to your proposals (the motivation may be identical). 
3. Some artifact to represent your work. Depending on the project you propsed, this make take the form of code, a website, browser extension, a pdf of a high fidelity prototype, a large dataset you analyzed, etc. You have a lot of freedom here, but if you're worried about what you're planning to submit, please feel free to run it by me in advance!
