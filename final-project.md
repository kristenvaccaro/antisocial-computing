# Final Projects

### Week 4: Proposal

Your team's proposal should be 250-500 words (1 page maximum) and should be submitted by the end of Week 4 (Sun 2/5 11:59pm).

Here is a set of example proposals so you can get a sense of the variety of things folks have worked on in the past in this class! Quick shoutout: one of these proposals turned into a paper that we submitted earlier this month and two others are ongoing & likely to be submitted this spring! So if you're interested in research, these projects can be a great place to start!

### Week 6: Plan

Please create a _brief_ project plan, which will be evaluated by both your peers and instructors for potential risks. We will provide feedback on all styles of projects (e.g., data mining, audits, etc.), but this is critically important if you will have contact with or involve any people in your project. If so, please make sure you include: 1) your sample and any inclusion/exclusion criteria, 2) how/where you plan to recruit, and 3) **every** question you plan to ask (interviews, surveys, etc.) as well as any interventions or systems you plan to ask people to use. If you will have a system, please provide mockups that are detailed enough to see what your participants will see and/or do.   

Please submit on Canvas by the end of Week 6 (Sun 2/18 11:59pm). Please only have one student per group submit!

### Week 10: Presentations

All projects will present during class in Week 10 (amount of time for presentations will depend on the number of groups).   

### Week 11: Final(s Week) Submissions

Your final submission should have the following:

1. A recording of a 5 minute summary of your project. These will be very similar to the in-class presentations (focus on overall motivation, quick overview of methods and results, and connections to course themes). 
2. A one page maximum summary. These will be very similar to your proposals (the motivation may be identical). 
3. Some artifact to represent your work. Depending on the project you propsed, this make take the form of code, a website, browser extension, a pdf of a high fidelity prototype, a large dataset you analyzed, etc. You have a lot of freedom here, but if you're worried about what you're planning to submit, please feel free to run it by me in advance!

Submit to Canvas by Wed 3/22 11:59pm. _We can offer extensions to a small number of groups if needed, please reach out directly to me by email to coordinate a late submission time._
