### Week 4: Proposal

Your team's proposal should be 250-500 words (1 page maximum) and should be submitted by the end of Week 4 (Sun 2/5 11:59pm).

Here is a set of example proposals so you can get a sense of the variety of things folks have worked on in the past in this class! Quick shoutout: one of these proposals turned into a paper that we submitted earlier this month and two others are ongoing & likely to be submitted this spring! So if you're interested in research, these projects can be a great place to start!

### Week 8: Pitch Video

Please create a _very brief_ pitch video to interest other students in your project. Your video should be 30-60 seconds. Your goal is to convey why your project is interesting and students might be interested in your topic. 

Submit the video as an unlisted video on Youtube. We will create a playlist from all these videos to share with the class!

- a summary of the objectives of the paper
- definitions or explanations of key concepts
- identify relationships/connections to concepts previously covered
- examples of an application of the key concepts
