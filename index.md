# Antisocial Computing: Winter 2023

<img src="https://github.com/kristenvaccaro/antisocial-computing/blob/gh-pages/img/05onfire1_xp-superJumbo-v2.jpeg?raw=true" width="400">

'The internet is a trash fire,' according to some experts. What has gone wrong? And how can we fix it? This course will explore many of the problems of social media: disinformation, bias, extremism, surveillance, among others. Students will learn 1) how design choices (in interfaces and algorithms) can impact the function and style of online communities, 2) how aspects of human psychology drive the problems that arise, and 3) understand how these same topics have been explored in art, fiction, and film. Using these theoretical understandings, students will explore how to design better social computing systems.

## Communication

Course related announcements will be shared on Canvas. Please use Canvas for your course-related questions as well!

#### Questions that are a good fit for Slack/Discord:
- Can someone help me understand this section of the reading?
- What would be some examples of \[topic from the readings\]?
- I'm stuck on the homework at \[xyz\]. Can someone suggest some ideas of what might be going wrong?
- The instructions for the assignment are unclear. Are we supposed to do \[x\] or \[y\]?
- I found a meme or news article related to class...

#### Questions that are a good fit for office hours:
- Here’s where I’m stuck on the homework... (can also post to Piazza)
- I don't think I quite understand \[topic\] yet. Can we talk about that?
- Can you give me feedback on my topic for the final project?
- I could use some tips on how to \[study for this class, read research papers, prepare for the final exam...\]
- What kinds of jobs use what we're learning in class?
- I'm not sure if I should apply for graduate school or industry jobs...

By default office hours will be group-office hours, as many students will have similar questions and can learn from each other. *If you have a personal issue*, please email me to set up a separate time.

#### Questions that are a good fit for email:
- Would you be willing to write a recommendation letter for me?
- I have a personal issue that will require submitting an assignment more than 5 days late...

## Inclusion Statement
It is my hope that we will develop a supportive learning community that will foster rich discussions through the sharing of personal ideas, experiences, and interpretations of the course material. Honesty, listening for understanding, a willingness to share your ideas, and respect for self and others are basic guidelines that can help create a positive learning environment. Your participation and feedback is important to the success of the course and I welcome your thoughts throughout the semester on how we might improve class processes that will encourage effective communication and dialogue.

## Student Support & Resources
I encourage you to devote time and energy to all of your needs. If you could use help on any dimensions, including your scholarly, physical, or psychological well-being, UCSD has a number of resources, [some which can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JgATnpJ6di513Pe_CqdOoSDaer_h6jz7oRQn7fZYNrA/edit).

I am committed (as is UCSD) to full inclusion in education for all persons. Services and reasonable accommodations are available to students with temporary and permanent disabilities, to students with DACA or undocumented status, to students with health or other personal concerns, and to students with other kinds of support needs. Please feel free to let me know if there are circumstances that emerge that affect your ability to contribute to the class.
